# Idea
During our roadtrip I wanted that everyone in my family could see what we would do everyday, and what we could do on a day. 
Just to give an idea to everyone in the family if they needed to get up early or not, what clothes to wear. 
Also i wanted to keep them a bit excited during longer stretches in the car. So by doing assignments ao roadtripbingo, everybody could win badges.
