# OurTrip
Show easy overview of the dayprograms of a family or group holiday trip

# Idea
During our roadtrip I wanted that everyone in my family could see what we would do everyday, and what we could on extra on a day. 
Just to give an idea to everyone in the family if they needed to get up early or not, what clothes to wear. 
Also i wanted to keep them a bit excited during longer stretches in the car. So by doing assignments ao roadtripbingo, everybody could win badges.

# Use
Familymembers or groupmembers (trippers) can use the app to see dayprograms and badges they have earned
Via admin site you can enter all the trip information, make badges available and assign badges to trippers.
